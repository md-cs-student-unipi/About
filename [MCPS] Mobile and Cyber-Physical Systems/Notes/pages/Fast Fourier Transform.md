The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is $O(N^2)$ with N being the data set of samples.

The Fast Fourier Transform FFT is a **class of algorithm for the calculation of the DFT** and also for its inverse.
*The number of operations is reduced a lot, making the numerical processing of the signals to be computationally feasible*.

The time complexity is shrink to $O(N log_2 N)$
