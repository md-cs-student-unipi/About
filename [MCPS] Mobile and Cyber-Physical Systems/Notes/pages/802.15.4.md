# ZigBee underlying layer

[[ZigBee standard]]
Oriented towards low-power networks, ZigBee allows the building of multi-hop networks, which is different from Bluetooth, which only allows communication with nearby devices.

Bluetooth Low Energy has a similar energy consumption, but it only supports communication with nearby devices, making it unsuitable for larger networks.

ZigBee is a specification for creating low-power personal area networks that can also support larger networks. It is infrastructure-less, meaning devices can be deployed in a field and they will work.

ZigBee devices are active even in short ranges, which is the range required to communicate with other devices (it doesn't make sense to have a wireless network that only works at long ranges).

ZigBee operates on license-free frequency bands:

-   860 MHz in Europe for 20 kbps
-   2483.5 MHz (2.4 GHz) worldwide, which is the most popular, with a maximum performance of 260 kbps.

## Physical layer

The physical layer provides two main services:

-   Data service: for transmission and reception of PHYSICAP PROTOCOL DATA UNIT (PPDU) through the physical medium
-   Management service: The management service allows devices to obtain the energy level in the channel to detect noise or to detect the carrier signal to determine if someone is transmitting. In ZigBee, you need to associate your network with a *channel that has a* low noise level. Parameters can be used to select the best channel for your network.

In the case of 2.4 GHz, channels are selected, in a way to avoid overlaps. ZigBee supports 11-26 channels of 2.4 GHz.

802.15.4 is designed to operate in non noisy channels. The higher the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the better it operates. The lowest SNR implies more noise and higher error rates, while the higher the SNR, the lower the bit error rate. For example, for ZigBee, there is a very low bit error rate for a low SNR.

**Signal to noise ratio higher means that more data can pass, without error made by noise.**
We can see in the graph how an high SNR means really low BER (bit error rate):
![[Pasted image 20230414153649.png]]
## Energy detection
There is the function of energy detection in the physical layer of ZigBee. This part is used to find a free channel and for carrier sense to find if someone else speaks in the channel. Also the estimation time for Energy Detection is equal to sending an average of an 8 symbols interval. The detection threshold is at 10 dB above the sensitivity level. The Energy result is given in byte. 

## Link Quality Indicator
This metric is used in multi-hop routing. 
The Link Quality Indicator (LQI) indicates the quality of the data packers received by a nodes. It is assessed each time a packet is received and it must have 8 different levels. *It is based on Energy Detection or SNR or both*

*The estimated value is then forwarded to the network and application layers*
## Channel Assessment
**The channel assessment function, checks if the channel is busy**
It has three modes:
* Mode 1: uses ED, finding a channel busy if the energy level exceeds *the detection threshold*
* Mode 2: Carrier Sense: finds that the channel is busy *if the detected signal has the same characteristics as the sender*
* Mode 3: combines the modes in an AND or an OR
## Data Services
In the Physical layer, a PPDU message will report on the above layer if a transmission was a success or a fail

The reason for failure may be:
* radio trans receiver is out of order (old packet or missing packet)
* radio trans-receiver is in receiver mode
* radio transceiver is busy


## Frame
The initial part of a ZigBee transmission includes:
-   Preamble: A special encoding is transmitted to allow the receiver to synchronize with the rest of the transmission. This synchronization continues until the end of the transmission.
-   SFD (start of frame delimiter): Tells the receiver when the real data will start.

The header includes the frame length which is 7 bits, meaning 128 bytes of payload. Not all bytes need to be used, as it is better to transmit short frames to reduce problems with carrier sense and collisions.
![[Pasted image 20230414154628.png]]
The frame length is encoded in 7 bits, and we have a payload of max 127 bytes.
# MAC Layer

Above the Physical Layer
-   Data Service: transmission and reception of MAC frames (MPDU) across the physical layer.
-   Management Service: For example, assigning transmission slots for transmissions that require synchronization and association and disassociation of devices.

## Device Types

There are two types of devices corresponding to the roles they play in the network:

-   FFD (Full-Function Device): A device that implements the full MAC protocol.
-   RFD (Reduced-Function Device): A device that implements only the mandatory part of the protocol.

These two device types are mapped to the [[ZigBee]] specification, with RFDs serving as end devices and coordinators and routers serving as FFDs. In some specific cases, such as in a star network, an RFD may be used at the MAC layer.

## MAC Layer Topologies

There are two main topologies in the MAC layer:
-   Star
-   Mesh/Peer-to-Peer

In ZigBee, all three topologies can be mapped to peer-to-peer because devices in the MAC layer only see their neighbors.

### Star Topology

In the star topology, we have an FFD at the center, which acts as the coordinator. From the 15.4 standard onwards, all devices are seen as behaving as reduced-function devices, even if routers are FFDs. In a star topology, a router will act as an FFD as its additional functionalities will not be used.

### Mesh/Peer-to-Peer Topology

In the case of the P2P topology, which supports the mesh and peer topologies of ZigBee, coordinators and routers are all full-function devices, while RFDs serve as endpoints.

## Type of frame
* Beacon frame
* Data frame
* Acknowledgement frame
* Command frame (MAC)
# Channel Access

The channel access can be done:
* with super-frame: used in star topologies or peer to peer organized in threes, it enforce synchronization of devices enabling power savings.
* without super-frame: here there cannot be coordination, so the energy efficiency optimizations cannot be done.

Channel access is implemented by means of a coordinator in a star topology. The coordinator will emit beacons, which define its activity period. If beacons are used, then a super frame structure is defined.

In 802.15.4, mechanisms are used to implement energy efficiency. The coordinator has a duty cycle of the radio, with a period where the coordinator is active. In the rest of the time, the radio will be off. The coordinator uses a period to state when the activity period will start. All the nodes can then be initialized in the star topology.

The network may operate without a superframe structure, which may save energy. In the past, it was used, and above the MAC layer, one could decide when to turn on or off the radio.

The super-frame structure has two parts: the activity period and the inactive period. Data is transmitted in the active period in one slot. The first part is transmitted by the coordinator, which states the network identifier, activity period start, length, and all parameters of the network.

To discover an existing network, you set up a radio on the channel and await the beacon. If no beacon is received, the channel s considered idle, and the device can set up its network.

![[Pasted image 20230618110055.png]]
**The beacon frames are send by coordinator in a star topology**

![[Pasted image 20230414155710.png]]
The active period is divided to up to 16 slots, in the example 14. Those slots are used:
* to communicate with the coordinator
* or from the coordinator to send a frame to a device

In the inactive period the devices can sleep. All the other node in the network must obey to the request of the coordinator to send messages.
## Contention or Contention free

Some slots may be reserved for some devices. In this way for a specific device the slots are guaranteed.
The active periods may be divided in:
![[Pasted image 20230414162516.png]]
* CAP(Contention Access Period): It is mandatory that at least one contention slots and must be available, as it is used *for the maintenance of the network*. A join requires the use of a contention slot also, so it is needed for that. All other may be the guaranteed time slots. There are at most 15 CAP slots. Any contention-based transaction must be completed before sending the Contention Free Period..
* Contention Free Period: means fixed for some devices, this is **for devices that require to be activated at a given time, which is fixed**. All device will know about those guaranteed time slots, and only authorized application will talk. In this case CSMA/CA may be not used, as all other device will be silent. Within the same slot of GTS (guaranteed time slot), there is the time to receive acknowledgement. A device that transmits in a GTS should finish its transmission within it.
If an application misses the GTS guarantee, then one must wait for the **next super-frame**.

*In a multi-hop path, one must ask to its own router, but it is unclear how it works*. The contention free slots are mostly thought about in start networks.
### CAP backoff
The end-devices will use CSMA-CA protocol
1)  at first they wait a random number of slots (so that they luckily do not rush together to occupy the same slot) 
2) if it is busy, they wait another random number of slots before trying again
3) if they find the channel idle, they can transmit and they do, **they will keep the medium until the end of the frame after gaining access, noting that they can transmit only on that slot** (they need to go to step 1 again at next slot). 


## Channel access with superframe (beacon enabled)
The coordinator of the PAN creates its own *superframe*.
The characteristics of channel access with superframe are:
* the active period of the superframes are always of the same length.
* it is the coordinator that *initiates* the superframe, composed of the Beacon frame and the frames sent in the CAP and CFP (which we see above).
### Channel access with superframe in P2P topologies
**Routers will synchronize with neighbours in a p2p network, by using the superframe emitted by the coordinator of their PAN.**


## Channel Access without Super-frame (non Beacon enabled)

The network is without instructions, so there are no slots. The communication is based on unslotted CSMA-CA protocol, so there are no slots like in CAP (which used CSMA-CA too).
*This PAN, where the coordinator decides not to use the super-frame structure* is called **non** beacon enabled.

This means that *the coordinator/router (referred both as coordinators) must be on anytime*, the RFD can *stay off and wake up only when they want to send something.*
The coordinators will stay active to receive data from end-devices.
Also the Coordinator and Router have a more complex protocol to message with a RFD, as they can be inactive.

### Poll-based data transfer in non Beacon enabled channels

The data transfer without superframes is poll-based. A device will periodically wake up and poll the coordinator for any pending message for which it is the destination.
The coordinator (router or PAN coordinator) can send two type of responses:
* the pending message
* a signal that no message is pending

# Data Transfer Modes
There are three types:
1) End-device to coordinator (PAN coordinator or router)
2) Coordinator(PAN coordinator or router) to end-device
3) Peer to peer (end device to end device may be possible, besides coordinators communication)

* star topology: uses only types 1 and 2, **because the data transfer can only happen between PAN coordinator and the other devices, as the PAN coordinator is at the center of the network**
* peer to peer topology (tree or mesh): all three type of data transfer mode may be possible, as data can be exchanged by any pair of devices

There are different implementation on Beacon enabled and non beacon enabled networks.

## Data Transfer in BEACON ENABLED NETWORKS

In this case there is a difference of the interaction in a  star topology or in a peer to peer (mesh and tree) topology, as we will see.
### From end device to coordinator (in star topologies)
In Beacon Enabled Networks, there may be problem when communicating from an end device to a router, as the end device needs:
* to own a GTS and be able to use it without contention to talk with the coordinator
* if it does not own a GTS to transmit the data frame to the coordinator by acquiring a CAP slot, during the CAP period **using the CSMA-CA protocol.**
We may see below how the Device listens to the beacon, then it the active period it sends Data to the coordinator,  optionally the Coordinator may send an ACK.


![[Pasted image 20230703175315.png]]
### From coordinator to end device (In star topologies):
We may see below the interactions of PAN Coordinator and Device.

![[Pasted image 20230703175333.png]]
	

1) A flag in a list on the Beacon, will state if a *pending message is available from a device in the Coordinator*.
2) the device wakes up to listen to the beacon. If the end device sleeps when there is the beacon frame, the coordinator will continue to advertise the available data.
3) In a free slot (Contention Access Period, accessed with CSMA-CA), the end device will send a Data request message to the coordinator. The request is *immediately acknowledged by the coordinator after receiving the the request*.
4) In a successive free slot (CAP), the coordinator sends the pending message data. 
5) The device will then send an ACK **on another slot!**.  The ACK is necessary in all those case, to allow reconfigurations internal.
6) the coordinator upon receival will in fact change its internal configuration by removing from the list of pending messages the pending message.



### P2P (tree and router) data transfer in BEACON ENABLED NETWORKS

In this case :
* coordinator devices (PAN coordinator or routers) will communicate with end devices **using the star topology interaction schema**
* end to end devices **will not be able to communicate directly and must forward their message to a coordinator (router or PAN coordinator)**, recursively reducing to the previous case


#### Coordinators communication

We have multiple Routers or the PAN coordinator which are are not synchronized, as they would collide. When one router wants to transmit to another router, it must find a *free contention slot in the other router activity period*. ****
**How to do this synchronization is beyond the scope of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, but must be defined by the programmer**
![[Pasted image 20230414164919.png]]


## Data transfer in NON BEACON ENABLED NETWORKS
Even in this case there is a distinction between star topologies and p2p
### From end device to coordinator (In Star topologies)
1) The communication from any device to the PAN coordinator is done by having the end device check with CSMA-CA that the link is idle, so "unslotted"
2) The device sends the data in the unslotted CSMA-CA. As a consequence  **the coordinator must always be active to receive the data**
3) the coordinator may send an optional ACK


![[Pasted image 20230703182808.png]]

### From coordinator to end device (in star topologies):
(In this case the coordinator considered is also a router, besides the PAN coordinator).

optional acknowledgement or the ACK if they are request.
There are no beacons advertising the pending messages to the device, the device must do polling to find if there are messages pending with it as destination

1) In this case, at any time, depending on CSMA/CA free slot the device sends a Data Request to the Coordinator
2) then the coordinator sends an ack (but not a response with data or empty)
3) the coordinator **transmits the data or an empty message if no message pending**
4) the device sends an obligatory ack
5) the coordinator discards the message
* .![[Pasted image 20230414165230.png]]


### P2P (tree and router) data transfer in NON BEACON ENABLED NETWORKS

In this case :
* all devices may communicate with every other device in their transmission range (using CSMA-CA to get an unslotted slot)
	* **but to do so all devices must be always active or be synchronized**
		* synchronization in this case too goes beyond the standard 802.15.4 and **it is said that is left to the upper layers!**

Question (missing in the published slides):
1) beacon (from coordinator)
2) data request (from end device)
3) ack (from coordinator): **immediately sent from coordinator**, allowing to state that it will sent in the next activity slot
4) data (from coordinator): sent in a free slot of the activity period during the CAP
5) ack (from end device): **immediately send from end device** from there the coordinator can now discard the data

# MAC Layer Services
The primitives to communicate with the Network layer from the  MAC layer are the same as [[ZigBee standard]]:
![[Pasted image 20230703184403.png]]

## MAC Layer: Data Service

It uses the primitives request, confirm and indication.
Where:
* Data.request: is invoked by the Network layer above with the objective to send a message to another device
* Data.confirm: reports the result (returns a success or an error code) of the transmission to the Network layer, it is send after a DATA.request and the attempt of data transmission
* Data.indication: it is a *receive* primitive, basically its generated by the MAC layer when receiving a message from the physical layer that came from another device, it allows to pass the message to the network layer


We may see here the exchange:
![[Pasted image 20230703184811.png]]

The Data confirm:
* instantly if there is no ACK to wait
* after ACK if it is optionally inserted.
In the latter case the originator device may wait a lot as to send a one must find a free slot (from a beacon or a CSMA-CA free slot), then also the receiver must find a free slot, which must be got by a beacon frame that may be awaited (in the next period), then only after this process the MAC layer sends a Data confirm.

The receive here is seen as a DATA.indication, the data goes up with *different possible implementations, not specified here*.

## MAC management service

The MAC layer services are offered to the above levels, to create a PAN and start transmitting beacons.
*Also it must provide the detection of existing PAN, with device association and disassociation of devices to an existing network.*
There may also be other services.
For completeness we may see Management services offered by the MAC layer and see that some may have or not additional primitives included, with a distinction from RFD and FFD.
![[Pasted image 20230703190326.png]]

In some case, the Indication and or Request may be optional or not.
For example ASSOCIATE, indication and response are optional, this is because there are two ways to connect on an existing network:
1) own will from a device: in this case ASSOCIATE needs to have Request, Indication, Response and Confirm for a FFD, because a FFD may receive a request actually, while there is no need for **request in RFD**, neither there is an Indication for RFD (as there just needs to be a confirm, no one will ask for an associate to an end device).
2) force a device, from coordinator to join an existing network here there needs to be an indication and response in the RFD to communicate the request from the coordinator to join with an indication to the upper layer and the response to the coordinator



Other  examples here:
* BEACON-NOTIFY: a service from MAC layer to advertise that it has received a beacon to **upper layer**.
* GTS: it is an optional service, to request a guaranteed contention slot.
* START: optional sued only by coordinator, to say that they start a PAN, it can be done to do service discovery.

# Associate Protocol
Protocol by an end device willing to join a network.

ASSOCIATE must specify channel it wish to connect and other parameters.
The MAC Address of the end device is the only one to communicate, as it is not on the network yet.

The association request is sent during the CAP, using a slotted CSMA-CA protocol.

The ack of the coordinator does not imply confirmation of the request.

On the joining device
![[Pasted image 20230414171015.png]]

When knowing the PAN adress. The MAC layer of the coordinator will receive a Associate.request.
![[Pasted image 20230414171116.png]]

Note that before sending ASSOCIATE request: MAC layer awaits a beacon, to get a free contention slots, the Coordinator MAC sends instantly a ACK after.
Meanwhile the MAC layer of the coordinator, sends an ASSOCIATE.Indication, the NWK chooses a Network address for the device.
From a indication to response, it takes time.
If it is a *router rather than a coordinator, than the response can be faster, without waiting for the coordinator*.


**The MAC layer, cannot answer directly the response of the associate request**.
We may even be in the inactive part of the network after the NWK layer computes what it did.
It makes a pending frame to respond,.

The MAC layer of the originator device, knowing the estimated time of the computation. **It waits a predefined period of time, define by the standard to take into account the time of a coordinator to produce a response, after such time a data request to end the pending frame to it**.
The request is immediately ACK.
Then the MAC layer of the Coordinator will send on a free contention slot the frame.
The ACK is received instantly from device.
**This ACK is important, as from there a COMM_STATUS.indication is forwarded from MAC to NWK layer, which must be used to say that the bind of address and device is successful**.
COMM_STATUS is a way to extend the type of requests, when REQUEST, INDICATION , RESPONSE were already used with a function, as happened with ASSOCIATE.

From there the [[ZigBee standard]] address map, from MAC addr to IP addr ill be updated.
